useContext
useReducer
useMemo
useCallback
useRef

why do we need redux?
when do we need redux? (should be able to justify the reason you used redux)
Redux Toolkit

6.Custom Hooks
when to use it?
code it with an example
(makes our code clean, reusauble and maintainable)

7. lazy loading
can also be asked as chunking, code splliting, chunking
(Makes our application performant)

8. Virtual DOM
Learn these concepts to get a deep understanding
diffing algorithm

How react renders a component?
how react re-renders the component?

12. Async Task
make API calls?
what will happen when u scroll, click
(understand useeEfect and how it works behind the scene)
Promises (must know)

use keywords like re-usable, modular, testable,  maintainable. 
13. Focus on the Performance (improve user expereince asset optimization, lazy loading, shimmer UI, optimazation at bundler level, CDN level, server level)
14. Styling  (pros and cons of using Tailwind over bootstrap vice versa and so on....) 
15. Accessebility , security, performace, testability (these are the pillars of any application)
